You are an expert React Native + Expo engineer helping build a production-quality reading and audiobook app.

You write clean, simple, maintainable code. You prioritize clarity over unnecessary abstraction because this app is built feature by feature and must stay easy to reason about.

You should think like a senior mobile developer, and implement like someone shipping a real consumer product to Google Play.

## STOP — five rules that are not negotiable

Read these before writing any code. Each one has already cost this project
real time, or would cost a user's data. They are expanded further down; this
block exists because the detail sits 600 lines away and nobody scrolls.

**1 · The service-role key never enters this app.** Not in `.env`, not behind a
flag, not in a build constant, not "temporarily to test something". It bypasses
every RLS policy in this document. Anything needing it runs in an Edge
Function. If a task seems to require it in the client, the task is wrong.

**2 · Never write to `books`, `chapters`, `app_settings` or `activity_log`.**
This app is a **reader**. Those tables belong to the admin dashboard — a
separate repo, `C:\Users\PC\Desktop\story-app-dashboad`, with its own
`AGENTS.md` — which is in production at `talebrim.com`. Create your
own per-user tables; altering theirs breaks a live product.

**3 · Filter `status = 'published'` on every catalog read — or use the views
that do it for you.** A draft is unfinished admin work. `books_catalog` and
`chapters_catalog` exclude drafts by construction, which is why they exist:
a query that forgets the filter cannot leak one.

**4 · A Clerk token carries two different `role` claims, and they are not
interchangeable.** Top-level `role` is always `authenticated` and is what every
policy's `to authenticated` matches. The operator role is the **nested**
`metadata.role`. Conflating them makes `is_admin()` false for everyone and
every policy denies everything. A reader needs only the top-level claim; this
app must never grant `metadata.role`.

**5 · One Clerk application, shared with the dashboard — and the same
instance.** The mobile client is a **Native application** inside the existing
`Talebrim` app, never a second Clerk application: two apps mint two `sub`
namespaces, so the same human becomes two unrelated accounts and no per-user
table can ever be joined across them. Reader-versus-admin is decided by
`metadata.role`, not by which app someone signed into (see Identity model).

The **instance** matters too: the dashboard is on **development** right now
(the production cutover was rolled back on 2026-09-19, cause unresolved).
Different instances mean different user pools — a user who signs in on mobile
would not exist to the dashboard, and vice versa.

> **When reads suddenly return nothing, check the session-token claim first.**
> Both Clerk instances are configured with
> `{"metadata": "{{user.public_metadata}}"}`. Without it, `auth.jwt() ->
'metadata'` is empty and every policy denies everything. It fails closed, not
> open — which is safe, but presents as a total outage rather than a
> permissions error, and has been misdiagnosed as exactly that before.

## Project Overview

We are building **Talebrim**, a read-and-listen mobile app for serialized romance, werewolf, vampire and fantasy fiction.

The app serves readers through:

- a text reader with light, sepia and dark modes
- chapter narration audio with background and lock-screen playback
- **read/listen parity** — one bookmark shared between reader and player, in both directions, across devices
- genre-based discovery and search
- a personal library with continue-reading and offline downloads
- rewarded-ad chapter unlocks and an ad-free subscription
- Mature content behind an age gate (**the label is `Mature 18+`** — see Data Contract)

The core differentiator is parity. If a user listens to chapter 12 in the car and opens the reader at home, the text must open exactly where the audio stopped. Architectural decisions defer to that.

Audience: adult women, core 25–44.

## Tech Stack

Use the following stack:

- Expo
- React Native
- TypeScript
- Expo Router
- NativeWind / Tailwind CSS
- Zustand
- AsyncStorage
- TanStack Query
- Clerk for authentication (`@clerk/expo`)
- Supabase for database and media storage (`@supabase/supabase-js`)
- `react-native-track-player` for audio playback
- RevenueCat for subscriptions and entitlements
- `react-native-google-mobile-ads` for rewarded ads
- Server-side route handlers or Supabase Edge Functions for secrets and privileged operations
- `expo-keep-awake` — M5 only (approved 2026-09-23; installed by prompt 14)
- `@react-native-community/netinfo` — wired once into TanStack Query's
  `onlineManager` in `lib/query-client.ts` (approved 2026-09-23; installed by
  prompt 15)
- `jest-expo` with `jest` — dev-only, unit tests under `__tests__/` (approved
  2026-09-24; installed by prompt 16)

Do not introduce new major libraries unless there is a strong reason.

---

## Development Philosophy

Build feature by feature.

For every feature:

1. Understand the user request.
2. Check this file before coding.
3. Keep the implementation simple.
4. Avoid overengineering.
5. Prefer readable code over clever code.
6. Build the smallest useful version first.
7. Refactor only when repetition or complexity appears.
8. Finish vertically — a screen is done when it renders real Supabase data and handles loading, empty, error and offline states.

---

## Decision Making & Clarifications

If something is unclear or could be improved:

- Proactively suggest better approaches
- If a new library would significantly simplify the implementation:
  - Recommend the library
  - Clearly explain why it is useful
  - Ask the user for permission before adding or installing it

Example:

> "Chapter lists run past 100 rows, so `@shopify/flash-list` would scroll better than `FlatList` here. Do you want me to add it?"

Do not install or use new libraries without user approval.

Also:

- Never replace a documented pattern with a deprecated one, even if an older snippet shows it (see Supabase Rules).
- Never invent product decisions — prices, plan names, discount percentages, chapter counts and free-chapter thresholds come from config or from RevenueCat.

---

## Architecture Guidelines

Use this structure unless there is a strong reason to change it. Everything
below lives under `src/` (`src/app`, `src/components`, …) and `@/` resolves to
`src/`. The one exception is `assets/`, which stays at the repo root
(`@/assets/*` → `./assets/*`).

```txt
app/
  (auth)/
  (tabs)/
  reader/
  player/
components/
constants/
data/
hooks/
lib/
store/
types/
assets/
```

### app/

Routes and screens only.

Screens compose components and call hooks/stores. They should not contain large reusable UI blocks or business logic.

### components/

Create a component only when:

- it is reused in multiple places
- it makes a screen easier to read
- it represents a clear UI concept like `StoryCard`, `ChapterRow`, `MiniPlayer`, `GenreChip`, `ProgressBar`, `SegmentedControl`, or `PrimaryButton`

Do not create tiny one-off components too early.

When unsure, ask:

> Should this UI be extracted into a reusable component, or should I keep it inside the current screen for now?

---

## UI Implementation Rules (VERY IMPORTANT)

For any UI-related task:

- The goal is to **replicate the provided design exactly**
- Match the UI **pixel-perfectly**

When the user provides a design image:

You MUST:

- match layout exactly
- match spacing and padding
- match font sizes and hierarchy
- match colors precisely
- match border radius
- match alignment and positioning
- match proportions of elements
- replicate all visible UI elements
- match component states: default, pressed, selected, disabled, locked, downloaded, reading
- match which screens show the bottom nav and which show the mini player

Do not approximate. Do not simplify unless explicitly asked.

### What is NOT binding in a design image

The V1 frames were produced by a UI generator. **All content inside them is placeholder** and must never be hardcoded:

- book titles, author names, synopsis and blurb copy, chapter titles
- counts and totals — chapter counts, audio ratios, result counts, footer tallies
- durations, word counts, file sizes
- dates and timestamps
- avatars, user names, email addresses
- prices, plan names, renewal dates, discount badges

All of it renders from Supabase or from seed content. Placeholder values are useful only as a hint at realistic string lengths — build for overflow, truncation and wrapping.

Numeric disagreements between frames (the same serial showing different chapter counts on two screens) are placeholder noise, not defects. Do not reconcile them and do not preserve them as data.

### Known design-file defects — fix, do not replicate

- overlapping elements in places
- mismatched or inconsistent icons
- segmented controls filled on the wrong option; the **selected** option is the filled one

---

## Design System

### Colors

| Token           | Hex       | Use                                                    |
| --------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `bg`            | `#150E1F` | Screen background                                      |
| `surface`       | `#1F1530` | Cards                                                  |
| `raised`        | `#2C1E42` | Nav, modals, sheets, toolbars                          |
| `ember`         | `#E8663F` | Primary CTA, progress, active tab                      |
| `ember-pressed` | `#FF8A5C` | Pressed state only                                     |
| `teal`          | `#9FD8D0` | Secondary accent, audio affordances, badges            |
| `blush`         | `#E9A8C0` | Decorative chips and labels only                       |
| `champagne`     | `#F4E3CE` | Serif headings on dark                                 |
| `body`          | `#F7F4F0` | Body text on dark                                      |
| `muted`         | `#A79BB5` | Captions, metadata, inactive nav                       |
| `reader-light`  | `#FBF7F1` | Reader light mode                                      |
| `reader-sepia`  | `#F2E5D0` | Reader sepia mode                                      |
| `ink`           | `#1A1420` | Text on light surfaces **and labels on ember buttons** |
| `destructive`   | `#C9705F` | Sign-out, destructive links                            |

Rules: flat surfaces; no shadows, glows, sparkles or text shadows; **no gradients anywhere except** one soft vertical `#150E1F → #2C1E42` on Now Playing, plus two fades approved on 2026-09-23 because a flat scrim left a hard seam over cover art: the onboarding collage fade and the M3 hero card's cover fade. All three live in `src/theme/colors.ts`; add no others without approval; **exactly one ember element per screen**, on the primary action; blush is decorative only, never body text; status is always a labelled pill, never color alone.

Ember button labels are `#1A1420`. Never white.

### Typography

- Fraunces 600 — titles and headings, in champagne
- Literata 18sp, line-height 1.7 — reader body text only
- Inter 14–16sp — all UI chrome
- Atkinson Hyperlegible — the reader's optional accessibility font, body
  text only. The original family (Regular, Italic, Bold, Bold Italic) is
  bundled, not the newer "Next" release.
- No script or decorative fonts

### Layout

393 × 852dp frames, 8pt grid, 16dp side padding, 16dp card radius, pill buttons, 2:3 covers at 12dp radius, 56dp mini player, three-item bottom nav (Discover, Library, Profile) with active ember and inactive `#A79BB5`.

## Screen Inventory

> Provenance note: these specs come from the design prompts and design-review notes for this project. Where a design image disagrees, **the image wins for layout and this file wins for tokens** — and flag the conflict rather than silently choosing.

**M1 · Sign In / Sign Up** — Cover collage across the top third. Fraunces headline "Pick up where you left off". Outlined pill buttons for Google and Apple. Email input. Ember pill `Continue with email`. Legal line noting 18+ (see Data Contract on the label-vs-enum split). No bottom nav, no mini player.

**M2 · Onboarding Genre Picker** — Top-third collage. Headline "What do you love to read?". Genre chip grid — the dashboard's genre list, mirrored in `data/genres.ts` (see Decisions); selected chips blush-filled, unselected outlined. Step indicator. Ember pill `Start Reading`. Muted `Skip`. Selections seed recommendations; persist them and never re-show the screen.

**M3 · Home / Discover** — Wordmark left; search and notification icons right. Horizontal tab strip (Discover, New, Werewolf, Romance, Vampire, Fantasy) with ember underline on active. Hero card with a single ember `Read or Listen`. Three carousels: Picked for You, Trending Now, New Audio Releases — audio titles carry a teal headphone badge. Mini player above bottom nav. Search icon routes to M8.

**M4 · Story Detail** — Flat `bg` surface (no backdrop); round back and share icons. Centred 2:3 cover. Fraunces title, author beneath. Metadata row: rating · chapters · length · status. Blush genre chips. `Read` ember pill beside `Listen` teal outlined pill. Thin progress line with resume label. Synopsis with `More`. Preview chapter rows with durations and lock icons, ending in an entry point to M9. **No bottom nav, no mini player.**

**M5 · Reader** — Light mode `#FBF7F1` by default (sepia and dark are user choices). Literata 18sp/1.7. Minimal top bar: back, chapter title, `Aa`. Fraunces chapter heading. Floating bottom toolbar on `#2C1E42` with brightness, `Aa`, bookmark, and a teal Listen icon that hands off to M6 at the equivalent position. Ember progress bar with position label. **No bottom nav, no mini player.**

**M5a · Paywall bottom sheet (over Reader)** — `#2C1E42` sheet, lock icon, headline naming the next chapter. Ember `Watch ad & continue`. Teal outlined `Go Ad-Free`. Muted restore-purchases and manage-subscription links. States the ad-free value proposition before any purchase. Never shown for an already-unlocked chapter.

**M6 · Now Playing** — The app's only full-screen gradient. Dismiss chevron. Large square cover with a thin ember rim. Title, author, chapter. Scrub bar with ember track and thumb, elapsed and remaining labels. Transport row: back-15, previous, 72dp ember play/pause with a `#1A1420` icon, next, forward-15. Secondary teal controls: speed, `Sleep timer`, `Read instead` — hands back to M5 at the equivalent position.

**M7 · My Library** — Fraunces title. Segmented toggle (Books / Audiobooks) on a dark track. `Continue` card: cover, title, progress label, ember progress bar, resume button. `My List` as a 3-column cover grid with an ember progress line under each; audiobook items carry a teal headphone badge. Mini player above bottom nav.

**M8 · Search & Results** — Back chevron plus search field in the header. Filter chips, active chip blush-filled. Result count line. Rows: cover thumbnail, title, author, metadata, audio badge where applicable. Recent searches when the query is empty. Needs a real empty state and a distinct no-results state.

**M9 · Full Chapter List** — Sticky header with cover and title. Sort toggle (Newest / Oldest). `Download all`. Long scrolling rows, each in exactly one state with a distinct visual: **Reading Now**, **Unlocked**, **Downloaded**, **Locked**. Bottom bar with `Unlock all chapters` and an ember `Go Ad-Free`. Must be virtualised — serials run well past 100 chapters.

**M10 · Subscription & Manage Plan** — Status card with current plan and renewal date. Switch-plan cards for Weekly, Monthly (blush savings badge) and Yearly (blush "Best value"); active plan carries an ember border. Confirm-change button. `Restore purchases` and `Manage in Google Play`. Muted cancel link. **Every price, plan title, badge percentage and renewal date is dynamic.**

**M11 · Profile & Settings** — Avatar card with name and plan badge. Upsell card with ember `See plans`. Three grouped sections as 56dp rows: Reading (text size, theme, Atkinson Hyperlegible toggle), Account (restore purchases, manage subscription), Support (help, contact). Sign-out link in `#C9705F`. Version string. Mini player above bottom nav. This is the Profile bottom-nav destination.

## Image Generation Rules

Do **not** generate, synthesize or substitute artwork, covers, avatars or illustrations. Cover art enters the system only through the admin CMS upload path, and missing art uses the placeholder in `constants/images.ts`. **That placeholder is not supplied yet:** until `cover-placeholder.png` exists, `Cover` renders a flat `surface` box (`// MISSING ASSET: cover-placeholder`).

Do not describe or imply AI-generated imagery in shipped UI copy.

If the user explicitly enables image generation for a local asset:

- match the provided reference exactly — do not change style, colors or composition
- keep consistency with the design system above
- place output in `assets/Image/` (capital I, singular — the folder on disk) with clear naming:

```txt
assets/Image/
  onboarding-collage.png
  auth-header.png
  cover-placeholder.png
```

Art direction when art is supplied: moody cinematic, moonlit tones, plum / charcoal / amber. No bright stock photography.

---

## Styling Rules

Use NativeWind Tailwind classes for styling strictly. Do not use `StyleSheet` unless the thing cannot be styled with Tailwind classnames.

Prioritize clean, readable mobile UI.

When building from an attached design image:

- match spacing closely
- match typography hierarchy
- match border radius
- match layout structure
- use consistent reusable styles
- make the UI responsive across screen sizes

Design tokens live in the `@theme` block of `src/global.css` as named colors, so classes read `bg-bg`, `bg-surface`, `text-ember`. Tailwind v4 and NativeWind v5 are CSS-first and read no JS config — there is no `tailwind.config.js`, and none should be created. **Raw hex appears in exactly one place: that `@theme` block**, mirrored in `src/theme/colors.ts` only for props that take no className (see Style Exception Rules).

Prefer reusable class patterns through utilities in `global.css`. If no utility exists and you see a repeated pattern, create one there following the BEM method.

Avoid large inline styles unless required.

---

## NativeWind Rule

Use the NativeWind version already installed in this app.

Before implementing styling or NativeWind-related code:

- Check the current NativeWind version in `package.json`
- Follow the syntax, setup, and patterns supported by that exact version
- Do not use APIs, config patterns, or examples from a different NativeWind version
- Do not upgrade NativeWind unless the user explicitly approves it

Refer to this for more info: https://www.nativewind.dev/v5/llms-full.txt

> Note: NativeWind v5 is a pre-release and its own installation docs state it is not recommended for production; v4.2.x is the stable line. The architecture handover for this project specifies v5. If `package.json` pins v5, confirm that is intentional before relying on v5-only syntax.

---

## Style Exception Rules

Use `StyleSheet` or inline styles for these components/scenarios instead of NativeWind classes:

| Component / Scenario                        | Why                                                                                | Use Instead                           |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **SafeAreaView**                            | From `react-native` or `react-native-safe-area-context` — className not supported  | Inline styles or `StyleSheet`         |
| **Button**                                  | Only supports `title` and `onPress` — cannot customize background, border, padding | `TouchableOpacity` with custom styles |
| **KeyboardAvoidingView**                    | Behavior props not supported by className                                          | Inline styles or `StyleSheet`         |
| **Modal**                                   | `visible`, `transparent` props                                                     | Inline styles                         |
| **ScrollView**                              | `contentContainerStyle`, `indicatorStyle`                                          | `StyleSheet`                          |
| **TextInput**                               | Input-specific props like `underlineColorAndroid`                                  | Inline styles                         |
| **Animated.View / Reanimated**              | Animated style values                                                              | `StyleSheet` with animated values     |
| **Dynamic styles**                          | Progress-bar width %, scrub thumb position, computed at runtime                    | `StyleSheet.create()` or inline       |
| **Platform-specific**                       | iOS-only or Android-only props                                                     | Conditional inline styles             |
| **Pressable/TouchableOpacity**              | `style` prop for pressed states                                                    | `StyleSheet`                          |
| **Shadow (iOS/Android)**                    | Different syntax per platform                                                      | `StyleSheet` with platform checks     |
| **Transform arrays**                        | Complex transform combinations                                                     | `StyleSheet`                          |
| **Z-index**                                 | Sometimes needs explicit StyleSheet                                                | `StyleSheet`                          |
| **expo-linear-gradient** (the three approved gradients only) | Colors are a prop, not a style                                    | Color array prop                      |
| **react-native-svg props**                  | No className support                                                               | `StyleSheet` or props                 |

### When to Use StyleSheet

- The prop is React Native-specific (not web-equivalent)
- The value is dynamic or calculated at runtime
- Platform-specific behavior is needed
- NativeWind does not map the property to a style

### SafeAreaView Example

```tsx
// ✅ CORRECT - Use inline styles or StyleSheet
import { SafeAreaView } from "react-native-safe-area-context";

function ReaderScreen() {
  return (
    <SafeAreaView style={{ flex: 1, backgroundColor: "#FBF7F1" }}>
      {/* content */}
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
}

// ❌ INCORRECT - Do not use NativeWind classes
function ReaderScreen() {
  return (
    <SafeAreaView className="flex-1 bg-reader-light">
      {/* content */}
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
}
```

Similarly for the other exception components. Otherwise, always stick to NativeWind utilities.

---

## UI Quality Bar

The app should feel:

- nocturnal
- premium
- immersive
- mobile-first
- visually close to the provided design references

Avoid neon, pastel or girlish treatments.

Use:

- flat plum surfaces
- clear spacing
- progress indicators on everything resumable
- friendly empty states
- large touch targets (≥ 44dp)
- restrained motion; no decorative animation

Every screen implements loading, empty, error and offline states. A spinner on a blank screen is not a loading state — match the surrounding surface.

Meet WCAG 2.2 AA contrast: 4.5:1 body, 3:1 large text.

Before calling a screen done, test the Reader at the largest supported text size and every list at the longest placeholder title.

---

## Image Rule

Use centralized image imports.

Before using any image asset:

1. Check if `constants/images.ts` exists.
2. If it does not exist, create it.
3. Import and export all app images from `constants/images.ts`.
4. Use images through the centralized object.

Example:

```ts
import onboardingCollage from "@/assets/Image/onboarding-collage.png";
import coverPlaceholder from "@/assets/Image/cover-placeholder.png";

export const images = {
  onboardingCollage,
  coverPlaceholder,
};
```

Use images like this:

```tsx
<Image source={images.coverPlaceholder} />
```

Do not require/import image assets directly inside screens or components unless there is a strong reason.

Remote covers come from Supabase Storage / CDN URLs stored in the database. Render them with `expo-image`, always with a placeholder and a 2:3 aspect ratio. Never hotlink third-party image URLs.

Where a cover must be cropped to a frame that is not 2:3 — the M3 hero card is the case today — use `contentFit="cover"` with `contentPosition="top"`. Cover art puts the title lettering at the top, and the default centre crop cut it off (fixed 2026-09-23). Crop from the bottom, where the card's fade covers the loss anyway.

---

## data/

Use this for seed and static content.

```txt
data/
  genres.ts
  seed-catalog.ts
```

Content must be typed. Never inline prose or catalog data into components.

---

## store/

Use Zustand stores here — one store per concern, not one god store.

Use Zustand for:

- in-flight read/listen parity position
- playback status and scrub position
- reader settings (theme, text size, font choice)
- reader position — a **character offset** into `script_text`, never a pixel
  scroll offset (a pixel offset breaks on a font-size change and cannot map to
  audio; see parity step 4)
- selected genre chips
- app settings

Use AsyncStorage persistence where needed — `persist` + `createJSONStorage`
over `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`, with `partialize` so only
local-only data is written to disk. Never persist a session token, a Clerk
object, an email, or a verification code — those belong in
`expo-secure-store`. Every persisted store ships a `version` and a `migrate`
function from its first commit, so a future shape change has somewhere to go
instead of handing a stale object to a component.

**Built (prompt 07):**

| Store        | Holds                                                              | Persisted?                                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `onboarding` | `hasCompletedOnboarding`, `selectedGenres`                          | yes — the only durable home for genres until Phase 2's profile table |
| `reader`     | `theme`, `fontSize`, `lineSpacing`, `atkinsonEnabled`                | yes — device-level, not per-account, so sign-out does not clear it |
| `playback`   | current chapter, playing state, speed, sleep timer                  | no — session only |
| `parity`     | the in-session authoritative reading position, keyed by chapter, with the server `updated_at` it last saw and a dirty flag | no — see Read/listen parity below; only `lib/parity/writer.ts` writes it |
| `search`     | M8's `recentSearches` (most recent first, at most 8) — added in prompt 11 | yes — per account, so sign-out clears it; never written to the database, and no search-history table exists or should |

`hasCompletedOnboarding` also drives the routing gate: `app/_layout.tsx` uses
Expo Router's `Stack.Protected` (not an imperative `router.replace` in a
`useEffect`) to compose it with the Clerk auth gate — not signed in → M1;
signed in and incomplete → M2; signed in and complete → past onboarding. A
completed user cannot navigate back into M2 by any path, including a
force-quit or a reinstall-then-sign-in, because the screen is removed from
the navigator rather than merely redirected away from.

`lib/session.ts`'s `clearUserScopedState()` — called by sign-out and by a
`__DEV__`-only button on the temporary index route — clears the persisted
TanStack cache, the persisted `onboarding` slice (so the next account on
this device sees M2 again, not the previous account's genres) and the
persisted `search` slice (one account's recent searches are not the next
one's), and resets `parity`/`playback` in memory. It deliberately leaves the `reader` slice
alone.

## lib/

Use this for external service helpers and pure functions.

```txt
lib/
  supabase.ts
  clerk.ts
  parity/       the one reading_positions writer, and its pure rules
  trackPlayer.ts
  revenuecat.ts
  format.ts
  cn.ts
```

No React, no hooks, no JSX in `lib/`.

Never expose secret keys in the mobile app.

---

## State Management Rules

Strict split — violating it causes the parity bug this app exists to avoid.

**TanStack Query** owns all server data: catalog, book and chapter metadata, chapter text, audio URLs, entitlements, unlock records. (Unlock records live in `unlocks`, which the app can read but never write. There is no entitlement mirror: subscription access comes from RevenueCat. See Data Contract.) It also owns offline caching via a persister. Query keys are declared in one place.

**Zustand** owns transient client state, as listed under `store/`.

Use local component state for temporary UI state.

### Read/listen parity — required algorithm

> **Built by prompt 16 (2026-09-24), in `lib/parity/`.** `writer.ts` is the
> only code that writes `reading_positions` or the `parity` slice.
> `reconcile.ts` is the last-write-wins rule; `convert.ts` maps text ↔ audio.
> M5 records through it, and M6 must too. How each step is resolved is
> recorded under Decisions — 2026-09-24.
>
> **Last-write-wins needs the server to set `updated_at` on every write.** That
> trigger is dashboard migration `20260924190305`. It is written but NOT
> APPLIED yet. Until it is, the first write's time never moves, so a position
> from another device is never adopted. Push it before relying on
> cross-device parity.

1. Write the position to Zustand immediately; local is the source of truth for the current session.
2. Debounce the write to Supabase — on pause, on chapter change, on app background, and on an interval.
3. Resolve conflicts **last-write-wins against the server timestamp**, never the device clock.
4. Store the position chapter-scoped as a pair: audio milliseconds **and** text character offset, plus which mode wrote it last, so a mode switch can map from the authoritative side.
5. Never block the UI on a parity sync, and never lose a local position because a sync failed.

---

## TypeScript Rules

Use TypeScript strictly.

Avoid `any`. No non-null `!` on genuinely nullable values. No `@ts-ignore` without a one-line justification.

Derive row types from the generated `types/database.ts` rather than redeclaring shapes. **Never hand-edit that file.**

Prefer discriminated unions over optional-field soup for asset states (`locked | unlocked | downloaded | reading`).

Keep types simple and readable.

---

## Feature Implementation Rules

When the user asks to build a feature:

1. Read this file first.
2. Identify files to change.
3. Keep changes focused.
4. Do not rewrite unrelated code.
5. Follow existing patterns.
6. Ensure the feature works end-to-end against real Supabase data.
7. Fix errors before finishing.

---

## Supabase Rules

Create the client with an `accessToken` callback that returns the Clerk session token:

```ts
// lib/supabase.ts
import { createClient, type SupabaseClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js";
import type { Database } from "@/types/database";

export function createSupabaseClient(
  getToken: () => Promise<string | null>,
): SupabaseClient<Database> {
  return createClient<Database>(
    process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
    process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!,
    { accessToken: async () => (await getToken()) ?? null },
  );
}
```

Get `getToken` from Clerk's `useAuth()`.

### Deprecated pattern — do not use

```ts
// ❌ DEPRECATED — do not reintroduce
createClient(URL, ANON_KEY, {
  global: { headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${clerkToken}` } },
});
```

Supabase documents the former Clerk Integration (project JWT secret + Clerk JWT templates) as **deprecated as of 1 April 2025**, because sharing the project JWT secret with a third party is a poor security practice, rotating that secret causes significant downtime, and minting a separate JWT adds latency versus using Clerk session tokens directly. Projects on the deprecated integration are excluded from Third-Party MAU charges only until at least 1 January 2026.

The architecture handover document for this project contains the deprecated snippet. It is superseded by this section.

### RLS

Identify the caller with `auth.jwt() ->> 'sub'` (the Clerk user ID, stored as `text`, never `uuid`). Roles come from Clerk `publicMetadata` via session-token claims. **RLS is the enforcement boundary** — client-side role checks are UX, not security.

---

## Identity model — ONE Clerk application, role decides access

**Decided 2026-09-20. Do not create a second Clerk application for the mobile
app.** The question was asked and answered; this section exists so it is not
re-litigated.

```
Talebrim  (one Clerk application)
├── Web application     → admin dashboard   → metadata.role = "admin"
└── Native application  → mobile reader     → no role (authenticated only)
```

Both surfaces share one user pool, one issuer, and one session-token claim.

### Why not a separate app for readers

The instinct is reasonable — different audiences, different products. It does
not work against this database:

**Supabase identifies every caller by `auth.jwt() ->> 'sub'`**, and validates
tokens against registered issuers. Two Clerk applications mint **two different
`sub` namespaces**. The consequences are permanent and hard to undo:

- `reading_positions.user_id` would hold ids from one app while
  `activity_log.actor_id` holds ids from the other. They could never be joined
  or compared.
- The same human signing into both surfaces would be two unrelated accounts.
- "Which readers are stuck on chapter 3", or an admin inspecting a reader's
  library, become impossible rather than merely unbuilt.

**The separation you want already exists, and it is not app-level.** It is
`metadata.role`:

|        | Token carries                                         | Result                                     |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Reader | top-level `role: "authenticated"`, no `metadata.role` | passes RLS as a reader, `is_admin()` false |
| Admin  | both, with `metadata.role: "admin"`                   | `is_admin()` true, dashboard access        |

That guard is verified in production: on 2026-09-19 an uninvited account signed
up through the live site and landed on `Not authorised`. One pool, two levels,
enforced in RLS rather than by which app someone signed into.

**"But there is only one admin" argues the other way.** One Clerk app means one
operator plus N readers in a single pool — ordinary. Two apps means two sets of
SSO credentials, **two session-token claims** (miss one and every policy denies
everything), two instances to keep in step, and two places to debug when auth
breaks.

### When a second app WOULD be defensible

Recorded so this is a judgement rather than a rule: if readers later need a
different MFA posture, a different consumer plan, or you positively want **no**
identity crossover between operators and readers. None of that applies now, and
splitting later is far easier than merging later.

### How to set it up

**Clerk → Talebrim → Configure → Native applications → add one for Expo.**

That yields a publishable key and redirect handling for the native client,
**inside** the existing application. Supabase needs no change — same issuer,
already registered.

⚠️ Point it at the **development** instance. The dashboard is on development
after the 2026-09-19 production rollback (rule 5, and `AGENTS.md` Deferred
Security Task 3). Two halves of one product on different instances means
different user pools, which is the exact failure this section exists to
prevent.

## Decisions — 2026-09-23

Made while reconciling prompts 12–15 with this file, the design frames and the
code. The prompts carry the detail; this is the record.

- **Prompt numbers.** The file names in `prompts/` are the numbers. The
  prompts were renumbered down by one, so code comments written before
  2026-09-23 may cite the old number (old 14 = current 13). Prompts not yet
  written are referred to by feature, never by number: `TODO(paywall)`,
  `TODO(parity)`, `TODO(handoff)`.
- **No UI without data behind it.** A frame element with no backing table or
  column is omitted and reported, not mocked: M4's resume card, My List,
  finished-chapter marks, rating and "Ongoing" status; M5's bookmark.
- **M4 Share** sends the title and author only. There is no public book URL
  and no deep-link scheme yet.
- **M4 layout.** No blurred backdrop: the frame has none, and the flat-surface
  rule argues against one. No mini player: the frame shows none, and the mini
  player lives in the tab shell, which M4 is pushed over.
- **Genres are the dashboard's slugs.** `books.genres` holds values such as
  `dark_romance`, written by the dashboard from
  `story-app-dashboad/src/data/genres.ts`. This app's `data/genres.ts`
  mirrors that list exactly; keep the two in step. Filters and saved
  onboarding picks use the slug. Every screen shows `genreLabel()`
  (`lib/labels.ts`), never the raw value. M2 offers the dashboard's twelve
  genres, replacing the eleven chips copied from the M2 frame, three of which
  (Mafia, Royalty, Forbidden) the dashboard cannot tag. The `onboarding`
  store's version 2 migrates saved names to slugs.
- **M5 Reader.**
  - Themes: `light` (default), `sepia`, `dark`.
  - Listen is teal outlined. The reader has no ember button; its only ember
    element is the progress bar.
  - The toolbar's sun icon cycles the theme. There is no brightness library.
  - Previous/next sit at the end of the chapter, not in the toolbar.
  - The position label sits inside the toolbar, in the bookmark's slot,
    and reads "N of M · X%", where X is progress through this chapter. A
    floating label over the text was tried and read as clutter.
  - A tap on the page toggles the toolbar; scrolling down hides it.
  - The reading position is a character offset, recorded once the scroll
    settles. Android sends no momentum-end event to a UI-thread scroll
    handler, so scroll-end events alone record the wrong spot.
  - Settings sheet: text size, theme, line spacing and a working Atkinson
    Hyperlegible switch.
- **Chapter text** is read once per chapter from `chapters` (the sanctioned
  exception in Data Contract). It is cached for 24 hours. Dashboard edits
  apply on the next open, never mid-read.
- **Migrations** live in the dashboard repo (Phase 2).
- **Unlocks are server-written only.** Readers can select their own
  `unlocks` rows and cannot insert, update or delete any. Otherwise anyone
  replaying their own token could grant themselves every locked chapter. The
  paywall prompt writes unlocks from a server function (`service_role`) after
  the ad network or the store verifies the ad or purchase.
- **Supabase's advisor flags all nine reader-table policies** with
  "auth_rls_initplan". That is a false positive of its text match: Postgres
  stores `(select auth.jwt() ->> 'sub')` as `( SELECT (auth.jwt() ->> …))`,
  which the lint does not recognise. `EXPLAIN` shows the claim read once per
  query as an InitPlan, with an index scan. Do not "fix" these policies.
- **Libraries approved:** `expo-keep-awake` and
  `@react-native-community/netinfo` (Tech Stack).

## Decisions — 2026-09-24

Made while building prompt 15 and reviewing prompt 16 against it.

- **One lock rule.** `chapterStateFor()` in `types/states.ts` wraps
  `resolveChapterState()` for a `chapters_catalog` row and treats a null
  `access` as locked. M4 and M5 both call it; nothing else decides a lock.
- **M5 as wired (prompt 15).** Text is fetched only for a published chapter
  that does not resolve to locked. The first text a reader receives stays
  until the screen unmounts. Next and Previous `router.replace` to the nearest
  chapter numbers either side, never n ± 1. The label's "of M" is the book's
  highest chapter number. The next chapter's text is prefetched at 80%, never
  for a locked chapter. Known gap: a dashboard edit made while a chapter is
  closed shows one open late, because the open paints the cached copy first.
- **Prompt cross-references.** Prompts 16–27 (written 2026-09-23 and 24) cite
  each other one number too high: they call the parity writer "prompt 17", M6
  "18–19" and the handoff "20". The file names are right. Fix each prompt's
  references when it is reviewed.
- **Parity writer (prompt 16).** How the five-step algorithm is resolved:
  - The server owns `updated_at`, through one additive trigger on
    `reading_positions` (`before insert or update`, reusing the dashboard's
    `set_updated_at()`), pushed from the dashboard repo.
  - One writer module, `lib/parity/`. Its queue and timers are module state, so
    an unmount can never cancel a write. It is not a `useMutation`: a failed
    write keeps the position instead of rolling it back.
  - Each write sends `chapter_id`, `book_id`, `last_mode` and only its own
    side. The upsert leaves the other side as it was, so reading never clobbers
    a listening position.
  - Last write wins by the server's clock. A session position carries the
    server `updated_at` it last saw, plus a dirty flag. A dirty position is
    flushed and wins. A clean one gives way to a newer server row. Device
    clocks are never compared.
  - Sign-out flushes first, then drops anything queued under the old account.
    The table's `user_id` defaults to whoever's token is on the request, so a
    late write would land in the next account.
  - Text ↔ audio maps proportionally within a chapter, from the text length
    and `audio_duration_seconds`. It falls back to the chapter's start when
    there is no duration. The data has no alignment, so it reports which of the
    two it did, and the handoff says so to the user. Start-of-chapter alone
    would restart every handoff, defeating parity.
  - M4's Read resumes the book's most recent position through
    `resumeTargetOptions()`, the query Library reuses.
- **M6 Now Playing (prompt 17).** Decided while reviewing prompt 17 against
  `material/8.png`:
  - Built on real chapter and book data, with only the playback mocked. The
    no-audio, locked and not-available states need real rows, and prompt 18
    wires audio, not metadata.
  - The hamburger has no defined function, so it is omitted, with a spacer
    keeping the header centred. The narration credit has no column, so it is
    omitted too. The red glow around the cover is dropped (no glows).
  - The cover's thin ember rim stays: AGENTS.md M6 specifies it. It is a
    decorative edge, so the play button remains the screen's one ember action.
  - "AUDIO SYNC ACTIVE" and "Shared Bookmark" render as static copy in the
    shell. Prompt 18 makes them truthful or hides them.
  - M6 slides up from the bottom, to match its down-chevron dismiss.
  - The scrubber is custom (gesture-handler and Reanimated), because no slider
    library draws the frame's 4dp track on Android.
  - The mocked shell never sets `currentChapterId` or `isPlaying`, or the mini
    player would show a track that isn't playing.
  - Speeds 0.75–2.0 and sleep timers of 5–60 minutes are standard player
    options, not taken from the frame. Revisit them if the product wants
    others.

## Build order — what to build, and what is blocked

**Do not start with the Reader and the Player.** They are the interesting
screens and they were the blocked ones: they depended on tables that now exist
(Phase 2, done 2026-09-23) and still depend on a storage decision that has not
been made. Discovery is unblocked, and
it teaches the data layer cheaply.

### Phase 0 — two decisions, before any code

**1 · Confirm the Clerk instance.** Development, to match the dashboard.
Settle it first or you debug two unknowns at once.

**2 · Decide the audio bucket.** This shapes M6 and the entire download
feature, so it cannot be deferred past Phase 2.

|                  | Private (today)                                   | Public                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| URL              | signed, expiring                                  | immutable, CDN-cached |
| Before playback  | a round trip to mint one                          | none                  |
| Offline download | signature outlives nothing — needs its own scheme | works directly        |
| Egress cost      | ~$0.09/GB uncached                                | ~$0.03/GB cached      |

`AGENTS.md` already states that `locked` is a paywall state **the app enforces
through entitlements, not a row-level secret** — so making `audio` public is
consistent with the existing security model rather than a weakening of it. It
is still a product decision and it is **not yet made**.

### Phase 1 — build against what exists (unblocked today)

**M1** sign-in · **M3** Discover · **M4** Story Detail · **M8** Search

These run against `books_catalog` and `chapters_catalog` now. Expect a real app
against real data quickly, and expect to learn what the schema actually needs —
which is the point of doing this before Phase 2.

`M2` (genre picker) is unblocked too, and as of prompt 07 persists through the
`onboarding` Zustand store (AsyncStorage-backed) rather than to Supabase —
that remains the only durable home for genre choices until a profile table
exists in Phase 2.

**Status, 2026-09-24.** Built: M1 sign-in and M2 genre picker (prompts
04–07), the navigation shell (08), M3 Discover on `books_catalog` (09–10), M8
Search on `books_catalog` (11), live catalog updates from the dashboard (see
Data Contract), the Phase 2 reader tables with their read-only fetchers
(13), M4 Story Detail (12), and the M5 Reader (14) on real chapter text (15).
The parity writer (16) is built. Its `updated_at` trigger (dashboard
migration `20260924190305`) is written but not yet applied. **Next: prompt 17,
M6 Now Playing.** M9 is still a placeholder route, and its prompt (20) is
empty. Open before M5 ships:
- The age gate (§ Content Rules). Every live book is `mature_17`, and nothing
  gates it yet. It needs its own prompt, and a decision on whether M1's 18+
  legal line is enough.
- M5's no-text state for a chapter with neither text nor audio (live: Man of
  Ashes 001 chapters 11 and 12). Its caption says "You can listen to it
  instead".

Decide before prompt 18 (M6 real audio):
- **The audio bucket (Phase 0, decision 2).** This file still records it as not
  made, and recommends public. Prompt 18 as written assumes PRIVATE, with an
  Edge Function signing each URL after checking entitlement. The two cannot
  both stand. Settle it, then fix whichever is wrong.
- **A development build.** `react-native-track-player` does not run in Expo
  Go, and this project has no dev client yet (`expo-dev-client` is not
  installed). Prompt 18 stops at step 1 without one.

### Phase 2 — the three reader tables (done 2026-09-23)

Write these **informed by Phase 1**, not before it. Four product questions have
to be answered first:

1. Does a rewarded-ad unlock **expire**, or is it permanent?
2. Is a reading position **per account** or **per device**?
3. Does `My List` (M7) store **order**, or is it sorted by recency?
4. Does an unlock belong to the **user**, or to the **user + chapter** pair
   with a count (e.g. re-watchable)?

Then: `reading_positions`, `unlocks`, `library_items`.

**Answered 2026-09-23:** an unlock is permanent; a position is per account;
My List is sorted by `created_at desc`, with no order column; an unlock
belongs to the user + chapter pair, one row each. The tables were applied
that day. See Data Contract for what exists.

**Every migration follows the discipline already proven here on 2026-09-20:**

- **Written, tested and pushed from the dashboard repo**
  (`story-app-dashboad/supabase/migrations`). It holds this database's only
  migration history, including this app's earlier `20260920000001` and
  `20260923000001`. This repo has no `supabase/migrations` and must not grow
  one — two histories against one database break `supabase db push`.
- **Additive only.** No `alter` on `books`, `chapters`, `app_settings` or
  `activity_log`. Those belong to a dashboard running in production.
- RLS on from the start, scoped to `auth.jwt() ->> 'sub'`, so a reader can
  touch only their own rows.
- `supabase db push`, then **regenerate types and diff them** — the proof a
  migration is additive is that the diff shows _only additions_.
- Re-run the dashboard's three gates: `typecheck`, `lint`, `build`.
- Re-run the RLS impersonation test as a non-admin **and** as an admin, so
  both audiences are proven rather than assumed.

### Phase 3 — the blocked screens, now unblocked

**M5** Reader · **M6** Now Playing · **M7** Library · **M9** Chapter List ·
**M5a** paywall · **M10**/**M11** subscription and profile.

Read/listen parity becomes implementable at this point and not before: steps
2–4 of its algorithm write to `reading_positions`.

### Before production — four things to plan for now

**Locked chapter text is not protected server-side.** RLS lets any signed-in
reader select `chapters.script_text` for any published chapter, locked or not
— by design, `locked` is enforced in the app, not a row-level secret. The app
never runs the text query for a locked chapter, which keeps the UI honest but
is not security: anyone replaying their own token can read every chapter.
Before launch, serve text through a server-side check of unlocks and
subscription entitlement (a `security definer` function or an Edge Function),
written as an additive migration in the dashboard repo — the `chapters`
policies stay the dashboard's.

**The instance is `t3.nano`.** `AGENTS.md` measures a **~450ms floor for a
trivial query** and concludes that **instance size outranks every code-level
fix**. No schema work makes this feel like a modern app. Budget the upgrade,
and lean on TanStack Query's persisted cache so a warm screen never waits on
the network.

**Seed more content.** Three published books, 31 chapters, four with audio
(2026-09-24). A Discover carousel, a 100-row virtualised chapter list and a
search results screen cannot be evaluated against that. Load it through the
admin dashboard — that path exists and exercising it is the point.

**Chapter text rides in the one persisted cache value.** The whole TanStack
cache persists as a single AsyncStorage value, and every chapter read in the
last 24 hours is in it. Live chapters reach ~315,000 characters (Man of Ashes
001 chapters 8–10 and 13). On Android a value past ~2 MB can fail to read back,
and then the cache fails to restore for every screen. Before launch, keep
chapter text out of the persisted cache (the persister's
`shouldDehydrateQuery`) once the downloads prompt gives text its own storage,
or cap it. The reader also lays a whole chapter out in one `ScrollView`, which
has not been tried at that length.

```

**Never put `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in this app**, in any form, including
behind a feature flag or in a build-time constant. It bypasses every policy in
this document. Anything needing it runs in an Edge Function.

This project uses the newer **`sb_publishable_…` / `sb_secret_…`** key format
rather than the legacy JWT-shaped keys. That matters in one recorded place: the
resumable-upload endpoint rejects them at parse, so a Node script written
against the old format will fail confusingly (AGENTS.md, prompt 16). The
mobile app does not upload, so it is unaffected — noted only so the format is
not mistaken for a misconfiguration.

### Clerk

Two instances exist, and **both are registered as Supabase Third-Party Auth
issuers**, so a token from either is accepted by RLS.

| Instance    | Issuer                                             | Use                |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Development | `https://cheerful-walleye-3066.clerk.accounts.dev` | local dev, Expo Go |
| Production  | `https://clerk.talebrim.com`                       | release builds     |

```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<pk_test_… for dev, pk_live_… for release>
```

**The session-token claim is the load-bearing setting.** Both instances are
configured with:

```json
{ "metadata": "{{user.public_metadata}}" }
```

Without it `auth.jwt() -> 'metadata'` is empty and **every RLS policy denies
everything** — which fails closed, not open, but presents as a total outage
rather than a permissions error. If reads suddenly return nothing, check this
before anything else.

Note the **two different `role` claims** in a Clerk token, which is a live trap
this project has already hit: the **top-level** `role` is always
`authenticated` and is what every policy's `to authenticated` matches; the
**operator** role is the nested `metadata.role`. Conflating them makes
`is_admin()` false for everyone. A reader needs only the top-level claim —
this app should never grant `metadata.role`.

⚠️ **The admin dashboard currently runs on the DEVELOPMENT instance.** The
production cutover was completed, verified, and then rolled back on 2026-09-19
when its sign-in card stopped rendering; the cause is unresolved. See
`AGENTS.md`, Deferred Security Tasks item 3, and
`docs/PRODUCTION-CLERK-CUTOVER.md`. Point this app at the development instance
too until that is settled, or the two halves of the product will be
authenticating against different user pools.

### Storage and the CDN

`app_settings` is a single live row and is the source of truth for these —
read it rather than hardcoding:

| Setting                  | Live value                                 |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `public_cdn_domain`      | `https://fwjrdzzdtshbqrfkgivd.supabase.co` |
| `bucket_name`            | `novelnow-media`                           |
| `storage_provider`       | `supabase_storage`                         |
| `free_chapters_at_start` | `3`                                        |
| `default_chapter_access` | `locked`                                   |

Cover URLs are built as
`<public_cdn_domain>/storage/v1/object/public/covers/<cover_path>`. The
migration's _default_ for `public_cdn_domain` is the stale
`https://cdn.novelnow.app` from before the rename — the live row is correct, so
read the row. If `app_settings` is ever empty the dashboard falls back to
`SETTINGS_DEFAULTS`; this app should surface an error rather than invent a
domain.

**Readers cannot select `app_settings` itself** — its policy is `is_admin()`,
so a normal reader gets zero rows (verified 2026-09-23; testing as the admin
hides this). Read the three values this app needs — `public_cdn_domain`,
`free_chapters_at_start`, `default_chapter_access` — through the
`reader_settings()` function (dashboard migration `20260923000001`), which
`appSettingsOptions()` in `lib/queries/app-settings.ts` already calls. It works
signed out too, and returns nothing else from the row.

## Data Contract — what actually exists in Supabase

> Verified against the live schema on 2026-09-20. The admin dashboard
> (`story-app-dashboad`, a separate repo with its own `AGENTS.md`) owns this database; this app is a **reader** of it.
> Anything below marked **does not exist** has to be built before the screen

> dashboard.

### Tables that exist today

| Table          | What it holds                                                                                            | Mobile use          |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `books`        | title, author, short*description, synopsis, genres[], maturity, status, cover*\*, default_chapter_access | M3, M4, M7, M8      |
| `chapters`     | book_id, number, title, script_text, audio_path, audio_duration_seconds, access                          | M4, M5, M6, M9      |
| `app_settings` | single row: CDN domain, accepted formats, free_chapters_at_start                                         | read-only config    |
| `activity_log` | admin audit trail, append-only                                                                           | **not for the app** |

Two views exist and are **shaped for the dashboard, not for this app**:
`chapters_list` deliberately omits `script_text` (it exists so the admin
Chapters table does not ship 50,000 words to render word counts), and
`chapters_needing_attention` is an admin work queue. Do not build reader
screens on either; they will be joined by a reader-facing view instead.

### The reader tables (migrations 20260923121634, 20260923121638, 20260923121642)

Applied on 2026-09-23 from the dashboard repo, and **purely additive**. A
before/after comparison of every object in `public` showed 0 removed and 0
changed. All 108 additions belong to these three tables, and the generated
types gained only their three definitions. These tables are this app's; the
migration files live in the dashboard repo, which holds the only migration
history (see Phase 2).

| Table               | One row per                          | Readers may                               | Read through (`lib/queries/`)        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `reading_positions` | reader + chapter (unique)            | select, insert, update, delete their own  | `readingPositionByChapterOptions()`  |
| `unlocks`           | reader + chapter (unique), permanent | **select their own only**                 | `unlocksByUserOptions()`             |
| `library_items`     | reader + book (unique)               | select, insert, update, delete their own  | `libraryItemsByUserOptions()`        |

- `user_id` is `text` (the Clerk `sub`, like the dashboard's
  `activity_log.actor_id`) and defaults to the caller's own `sub`.
- `reading_positions` holds `audio_ms`, `text_offset` (a **character**
  offset) and `last_mode` (`text` | `audio`). A check constraint requires the
  side named in `last_mode` to hold a value. `updated_at` is the parity
  clock. Trigger `reading_positions_set_updated_at` (migration
  `20260924190305`) sets it on every insert and update, overwriting whatever
  a client sends. **Not applied yet** (see parity above).
  `book_id` is denormalised so Library needs no join.
- `unlocks.source` is `ad` | `purchase`. A subscription never writes here:
  access comes from the RevenueCat entitlement at read time.
- Policies are `to authenticated`, scoped to
  `user_id = (select auth.jwt() ->> 'sub')`, with **no `is_admin()` branch**.
  An operator sees only their own rows. `anon` has no grants at all.
  `authenticated` has exactly the operations above: the project's default
  privileges would otherwise have handed every new table ALL rights, TRUNCATE
  included.
- Every foreign key is **`on delete cascade`**, so a book or chapter the
  dashboard deletes takes readers' rows with it, instead of the delete failing
  on them. Each foreign key is indexed, so the cascade never scans.
- Verified by `supabase/verify/reader_tables_rls.sql` in the dashboard repo:
  40 impersonation checks covering readers A and B, `anon`, and an admin, all
  passing on the live tables. It rolls back everything it seeds, so re-run it
  after any change to these tables:
  `npx supabase db query --linked -f supabase/verify/reader_tables_rls.sql`.

**Still does not exist:** `bookmarks` (M5's bookmark button is omitted until
it does) and any entitlement mirror.

### Column facts that change how screens are built

- **`chapters.access` is `free | locked`.** There is no "unlocked for this
  user" column, by design — that is per-user state and belongs in the missing
  `unlocks` table. M9's four row states are therefore **computed**, not stored.
- **`books.status` is `draft | published`.** The app must filter
  `status = 'published'` on every catalog read. A draft is unfinished admin
  work and must never reach a reader.
- **`maturity` is `general | mature_17`** — the enum value is `mature_17`
  and every label reads **`Mature 18+`**. Renaming the enum is a migration the
  dashboard shares; do not "fix" it in the app.
- **`chapters.audio_duration_seconds` is nullable, and so is
  `audio_duration_source`.** A file can be in storage with no duration ever
  measured — `loadedmetadata` reports `Infinity`/`NaN` for some encodings.
  Render a "duration unknown" state; never print `00:00` over an unmeasured
  file. The dashboard learned this the hard way.
- **`script_text` is plain Markdown with exactly three marks** — `**bold**`,
  `_italic_`, `## heading`. The admin editor stores nothing else, deliberately,
  because this app consumes the column directly. Parse those three; do not
  assume full Markdown.
- **Cover fields are nullable.** `cover_path` null is a legitimate state —
  render the placeholder, never a broken image.

### Storage buckets and the audio problem

| Bucket    | Public?         | Consequence for this app                                                         |
| --------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `covers`  | **public read** | Build URLs directly from `cover_path` + CDN domain. No signing, cacheable, fast. |
| `audio`   | **private**     | **Every track needs a signed URL, minted per playback.**                         |
| `scripts` | admin only      | Never touched by this app. Prose comes from `chapters.script_text`.              |

**The private audio bucket is the single biggest performance decision left
open.** Signed URLs expire, so they cannot be cached in the app or handed to
`react-native-track-player` for an offline download that outlives the
signature. Two options, and one must be chosen before M6 is built:

1. **Make `audio` public**, like `covers`. `AGENTS.md` already states that
   `locked` is a paywall state the app enforces through entitlements, **not a
   row-level secret** — so this is consistent with the existing security model
   rather than a weakening of it. Gives immutable, long-cached, CDN-served URLs
   and the cheapest egress.
2. **Keep it private** and mint signed URLs through an Edge Function,
   accepting a round trip before playback and solving offline downloads
   separately.

Option 1 is the one that matches "modern app" performance. It is a product
decision, not a technical one, and it is not made yet.

### Query patterns this app needs, and the indexes behind them

The dashboard's indexes are `chapters(book_id)`, `chapters(book_id, number)`
and `activity_log(created_at desc)`. **There is no index on `books.status`**,
which is the column every reader query filters on. Discover, Search and Library
all table-scan today. That is invisible at two books and will not be at five
hundred.

Additive index and view work is required before launch. It cannot break the
dashboard — indexes and new views change no existing table — but it must be
written as its own migration and verified against the dashboard's gates and
RLS tests.

### What has already been built (migration 20260920000001)

Applied to the live database and verified. **Purely additive** — no existing
table, view or policy was altered, which is what makes it safe to run against a
database the admin dashboard is using in production.

**Indexes:** `books(status)` — the column every reader query filters on and
which nothing indexed; `books` GIN on `genres` for the Discover tab strip and
Search chips (a btree cannot serve `@>` containment on a text[]); and a partial
index on `chapters(book_id) where audio_path is not null` for the audio-first
screens, which stays small because the catalog is mostly text today.

**`books_catalog`** — one row per **published** book with `chapter_count`,
`audio_count`, `free_chapter_count` and `total_duration_seconds` computed in
Postgres. Use this for M3, M4, M7 and M8 instead of querying `books` and then
counting chapters per row; that N+1 is what makes a list feel slow when a
trivial query already costs ~450ms. `total_duration_seconds` is **null, not
zero**, when nothing has a measured duration.

**`chapters_catalog`** — chapter metadata for M4's preview and M9's full list,
with `has_audio` / `has_text` booleans and **no `script_text`**. Fetch prose
per chapter from `chapters.script_text` when the reader actually opens one.
That single-row read by id (`chapterTextOptions()` in
`lib/queries/chapters.ts`) is the **one sanctioned direct read of `chapters`**.
It runs only after `chapters_catalog` has returned the same chapter — which
proves it is published — and never for a chapter that resolves to locked.

Both views set `security_invoker = on`, so the caller's RLS still applies.
Drafts are excluded **by construction**: a mobile query that forgets
`status = 'published'` cannot leak one, because there are none in the view.

Verified by impersonating a non-admin reader in SQL: `is_admin()` false, zero
drafts visible, no `script_text` column, `activity_log` and `app_settings`
still denied — and separately as an admin, confirming `chapters_list` and
`chapters_needing_attention` still return what the dashboard expects. The
dashboard's typecheck, lint and build all pass against regenerated types.

### Live catalog updates (migration 20260923000002)

Applied 2026-09-23 with the owner's explicit approval — **the one sanctioned
exception to "don't touch `books`/`chapters`"**. Six statement-level triggers
on `books` and `chapters` call `broadcast_catalog_change()`, which sends
`{ book_ids, chapter_ids }` (ids only, published books only, including
published → draft) on the private Realtime topic `catalog`. Its body cannot
fail a dashboard write: errors downgrade to a WARNING. A select-only policy
on `realtime.messages` lets signed-in users receive; there is no insert
policy, so no client can send on the topic.

App side: `hooks/use-catalog-sync.ts` (mounted in `app/_layout.tsx`) listens
while signed in and in the foreground, then invalidates the affected query
keys (`lib/catalog-sync.ts`). Every join does a catch-up refresh. Do not drop
the triggers or add columns to the payload; new screens get live data just by
using the key factory.

**Tokens keep the channel alive.** Realtime closes a private channel the
moment the token it holds expires, and realtime-js never rejoins a closed
channel. Clerk tokens live 60 seconds, and a cached one can already be expired
by the server's clock (seen on Android 2026-09-23 as "Token has expired 1
seconds ago"). So `refreshRealtimeAuth()` in `lib/supabase.ts` hands the
socket a newly issued token (`skipCache`) before every join, on every channel
error, and every 30 seconds. The hook rebuilds a closed channel with backoff
(1s, 3s, 10s, 30s). Ordinary REST queries keep using Clerk's cached token.

`realtime.messages` is partitioned by day, and Realtime creates the
partitions only when a client connects. With nobody connected the trigger's
send fails quietly, which is harmless because nobody is listening.

### Performance ceiling, stated plainly

The database is a `t3.nano` instance. `AGENTS.md` records a measured **~450ms
floor for a trivial query** and **1244ms for a cold `HEAD`**, and concludes
that **instance size outranks every code-level fix**. No amount of schema work
makes this feel like a modern app on that instance. Budget for an upgrade, and
lean on TanStack Query's persisted cache so a warm screen never waits on the
network.

---

## Clerk Rules

Use Clerk for authentication. Do not build custom auth.

**One application, shared with the admin dashboard** — see Identity model. The
mobile client is a **Native application** inside Talebrim, not a second Clerk
app. Do not create one.

- Publishable key only in the app. Secret keys never ship to the client.
- Token retrieval always goes through Clerk's `getToken`. Never cache a token in a module-level variable or in AsyncStorage.
- Sign-out clears persisted Zustand state and any user-scoped TanStack Query cache.

---

## Audio Rules

- `react-native-track-player` with background mode, lock-screen and Bluetooth/car controls, variable speed, sleep timer, and autoplay next chapter.
- Offline audio download is separate from offline text caching — implement both.
- Auto-bookmark on pause.
- M5 ↔ M6 handoff preserves position in both directions.
- Audio URLs from Supabase Storage are immutable and long-cached. Never append cache-busting query strings to media — cached egress bills roughly $0.03/GB against $0.09/GB uncached, so CDN hit rate is a real cost lever.

---

## Billing Rules

- Entitlements, restore and receipt validation go through RevenueCat. Supabase may mirror entitlement state for RLS, but RevenueCat is authoritative.
- **Plans, prices and renewal dates render from RevenueCat offerings/packages.** The prices in the M10 frame are placeholder.
- The yearly savings badge is **computed** from fetched package prices. Never hardcode a discount percentage.
- Restore Purchases is mandatory and must be reachable from M10 and M11 (Google Play policy).
- IAP does not work in Expo Go or on simulators. Plan EAS Build; test on real devices.
- Rewarded ads require a custom dev client. Never gate an already-unlocked chapter behind an ad.

---

## Content Rules

Catalog and chapter content come from Supabase, loaded through the admin CMS — the Talebrim Admin Dashboard, a separate repo at `C:\Users\PC\Desktop\story-app-dashboad` whose own `AGENTS.md` **owns this schema**. Read its Data Model Notes and Upload Rules before changing anything in Postgres: a migration written for this app can break that dashboard, and its three gates (`typecheck`, `lint`, `build`) plus its RLS verification are what prove it did not.

This app is a **reader**. It creates its own per-user tables (unlocks, reading positions) but must not alter `books`, `chapters`, `app_settings` or `activity_log`.

Seed content may live as typed JSON/TS in `data/` for local development.

The maturity flag is per book — respect it per title rather than assuming the whole catalog is mature. Show the age gate before content access. **The enum value is `mature_17`; every user-visible label reads `Mature 18+`.** That split is deliberate and shared with the admin dashboard — see Data Contract.

---

## Code Simplicity Rules

Avoid overengineering.

Duplicate twice; extract on the third use. No barrel-file re-export webs. No wrapper around a wrapper — if a component only forwards props, delete it. Delete dead code rather than commenting it out.

Refactor only when needed.

---

## Component Creation Rule

Only create reusable components when necessary. Ask if unsure.

Check `components/ui/` first. Today it holds `Badge`, `Button`, `Chip`, `Cover`, `Screen`, `SegmentedControl` and the `Body`/`Heading` type helpers. `ProgressBar` and similar do not exist yet — add them there when a screen first needs them.

Components take data via props and do not fetch. Fetching lives in `hooks/`.

Every interactive component implements its full state set and has an accessibility label.

Name by role, not appearance: `PrimaryButton`, not `OrangeButton`.

`SegmentedControl` must default to the correct option — this is a known defect source in the design frames.

---

## Linting and Validation

Run:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

Fix errors. A change that does not typecheck is not done.

Do not disable a rule to silence an error; fix the cause. An inline disable needs a justification comment. Do not reformat files you did not otherwise change.

---

## Communication Style

Be concise.

Lead with what changed and where — file paths, then the reason. Explain how to test.

Flag deviations from this file explicitly, with the source that justifies them. State assumptions and mark them as assumptions. If a design image and this file disagree, say so rather than silently choosing.

No progress narration. No restating the request. No summarising work visible in the diff.

---

## Important Constraints

**Supabase is the database.** Domain data lives in Postgres. AsyncStorage is for local-only concerns — onboarding completion, reader preferences, persisted Query cache — and is never the system of record.

Use:

- Supabase Postgres for catalog and chapters (existing), plus the reader tables `reading_positions`, `unlocks` and `library_items` (see Data Contract)
- Supabase Storage + CDN for covers and narration audio
- TanStack Query for server state
- Zustand for client state
- AsyncStorage for local persistence
- backend route handlers or Edge Functions for anything needing a service-role key

**Open item — iOS.** The stack lists Apple IAP, but every V1 frame is a 393 × 852dp Android frame. iOS layout, safe areas and App Store review specifics are unspecified. Confirm iOS scope before building for it.

---

## Final Reminder

Before every feature implementation:

- Read this file
- Follow it strictly
- Build clean, simple code
- Replicate UI exactly when designs are provided
- Treat placeholder content as data, never as constants
- Protect read/listen parity above all else

And the five non-negotiables from the top of this file, restated because this
is the section most likely to be re-read on its own:

1. The **service-role key** never enters this app.
2. Never **write** to `books`, `chapters`, `app_settings` or `activity_log` —
   this app reads a database the admin dashboard owns and runs in production.
3. Every catalog read filters **`status = 'published'`**, or uses the views
   that already do.
4. A Clerk token's **top-level `role`** (`authenticated`) is not its nested
   **`metadata.role`** (operator). Never grant the second from this app.
5. **One Clerk application**, shared with the dashboard — the mobile client
   is a Native application inside `Talebrim`, never a second Clerk app — and
   the **same instance**, currently development.
